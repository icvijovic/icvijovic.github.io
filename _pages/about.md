I am a quantitative biologist with a background in physics. I am broadly interested in understanding biological systems with a dynamical and evolutionary flavor using a combination of theoretical, computational, and experimental tools. My work often involves iterating between a realistic understanding of the known biology of a system and a theoretical lens based on simple dynamical models. I often use quantitative experimental technologies, which sometimes require me to develop new computational and statistical approaches. I generally thrive in team settings, and my work has been highly collaborative.

Over the course of the past few years, I have been particularly interested in understanding the dynamical processes that shape the adaptive immune system, which crucially relies on evolution to generate protective memory. I have been especially focused on  understanding how antibody-based immune memory forms over the course of a human life.

I am currently a postdoctoral research fellow in the Department of Applied Physics at Stanford University. I was part of the inagural cohort of [Stanford Science Fellows](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fstanfordsciencefellows.stanford.edu&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw0dQ510frxFyKJI350F9Ibv) and, prior to this, I spent a year as a [Lewis-Sigler Theory Fellow](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Flsi.princeton.edu%2Fpeople%2Flewis-sigler-fellows&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw3WwTGzp5cLvtk2gvNyHghJ) at Princeton University.  I received my PhD in Systems Biology at Harvard University advised by [Michael Desai](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.desai-lab.com&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw0tgNhPlaKEDh3ooruR0CqO),  and a BA and MSci in Experimental and Theoretical Physics at the University of Cambridge.
